# Readability
The term "readability" describes the level of difficulty a written passage is. Factors of word choice, sentence length, and grammatical attributes contribute to the overall difficulty of a passage. In traditional school settings, leveled books exist for children to expand their reading skills within their designated grade level. These books are written within guidelines that fall within state- and nation-wide English Language Arts standards. What if there is a passage of text that does not have a designated grade level? A teacher could manually read through and check the passage for indicators. This takes significant time and an expansive knowledge on grammar. This project explores the use of linear regression and text features to model readability scores. 

## Significance
The readability of a passage determines how well a reader interacts with the overall content of a passage. If they are struggling to understand the basic words and structure, they will not be able to comprehend and absorb the overall story line.

# easyCBM
Educational researchers at the University of Oregon developed easyCBM as a tool for assessing students on their reading skills. These short assessments give teachers insight into areas of struggle for their students, what supports teachers can provide, and how effective their overall teaching is (cite website). The easyCBM program uses reading passages that have been analyzed and scored for each grade level. With the permission of researchers, this project uses easyCBM passages to train and test the readability model.

# CORE
Computerized Oral Reading Evaluation (CORE) is a project led by Dr. Joe Nese housed within the Behavioral Research and Teaching Facility at the University of Oregon. This project is focused on using computerized assessment of oral reading fluency to analyze aspects of the reading process in 2nd - 4th graders (cite Joe's blog).
