# Readability
The term "readability" describes the level of difficulty a written passage is. Factors of word choice, sentence length, and grammatical attributes contribute to the overall difficulty of a passage. In traditional school settings, leveled books exist for children to expand their reading skills within their designated grade level. These books are written within guidelines that fall within state- and nation-wide English Language Arts standards. What if there is a passage of text that does not have a designated grade level? A teacher could manually read through and check the passage for indicators. This takes significant time and an expansive knowledge on grammar. This project explores the use of linear regression and text features to model readability scores. 

## Significance
The readability of a passage determines how well a reader interacts with the overall content of a passage. If they are struggling to understand the basic words and structure, they will not be able to comprehend and absorb the overall story line.
