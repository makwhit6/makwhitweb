# easyCBM
Educational researchers at the University of Oregon developed easyCBM as a tool for assessing students on their reading skills. These short assessments give teachers insight into areas of struggle for their students, what supports teachers can provide, and how effective their overall teaching is (cite website). The easyCBM program uses reading passages that have been analyzed and scored for each grade level. With the permission of researchers, this project uses easyCBM passages to train and test the readability model.
