# CORE
Computerized Oral Reading Evaluation (CORE) is a project led by Dr. Joe Nese housed within the Behavioral Research and Teaching Facility at the University of Oregon. This project is focused on using computerized assessment of oral reading fluency to analyze aspects of the reading process in 2nd - 4th graders (cite Joe's blog).
